# Private Exercise - Image slider page
The focus of this exercise was to learn and practice Javascript. I only decided to post it because I came to my own resolution which ended up being simpler than the one in the official class. 
*So there's no alternate screensize options.*

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Go through the images without issues. 
- Both arrows must lose cickability and opacity. The left one at the first page and the right one on the forth one.

*As mentioned, because this is a Javascript exercise, there was no alternative screensize options*
