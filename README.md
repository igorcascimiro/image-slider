# Private Exercise - Image Slider Page
The focus of this exercise was to learn and practice Javascript. I only decided to post it because I came to my own resolution which ended up being simpler than the one in the official class. 
*So there's no alternate screensize options.*

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Go through the images without issues. 
- Both arrows must lose cickability and opacity. The left one at the first page and the right one on the forth one.

### Screenshots

*As mentioned, because this is a Javascript exercise, there was no alternative screensize options made.*

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 custom properties
- Javascript

### Differences from the official resolution 

At the official one, 3 different functions were used.
- 1 to hide the 'slide' and show the next one (right arrow)
- 1 to hide the 'slide' and show the previous one (left arrow)
- 1 to give opacity to the arrows at the first and fourth slide.

My original resolution was able to use only two, one for each arrow, and have the whole effect using only two extra lines of code on each one.
